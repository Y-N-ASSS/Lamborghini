## **ENERGY**: 
### The power source is electricity instead of gasoline. Electrical systems are extremely efficient, allowing kinetic energy to be recovered to generate power. In order to exploit the opportunities offered by electric drivetrains, the battery system must be symmetrical and oriented toward power in order to ensure high levels of performance and the greatest possible level of energy regeneration. Lamborghini aims to develop an innovative supercapacitor that is able to fill the gap, in terms of energy density, with existing batteries.
